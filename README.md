2. How to define a Machine Learning problem
3. The Machine Learning engineering cycle
4. Set up a Pydata enviroment
5. Data preparation
6. Modeling and evaluation

**Thoughts:**

**Thoughts:**

1. I learned feature engineering techniques to apply to datasets like: reduction, transformation, scaling and binary encoding..
2. I can look to [ML.NET](https://www.microsoft.com/net/learn/apps/machine-learning-and-ai/ml-dotnet)  like a development framework growing fast and in a midterm it can help me develop business apps combined with ML. I like this idea...I have to start trying it.
